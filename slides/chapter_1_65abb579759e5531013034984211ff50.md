Welcome back. In this video we will be taking a look at primary keys and foreign keys.

## What Are Primary Keys

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "9489537124"
```

`@part1`
A column, or combination of columns, which uniquely identifies a record within a table.

They must be unique.

They cannot contain Null values.

A table can only contain one primary key.


`@script`
First, let's begin by looking at primary keys. What is a primary key? A primary key is a column, or a combination of columns, which uniquely identifies a record within a table. There are certain rules that a primary keys must comply with. Each value in a primary key column must be unique. A primary key cannot contain null values. And a table can only have one primary key. Let's take a look at an example of a primary key.

## Example of a Primary Key

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "302dac558b"
```

`@part1`
Artists table:

Add an id column:

`@script`
Let's take a look at a table from our music app that we saw earlier in the course. In this app we need to store data about different artists. This means we would have an artists table which would contain data such as the artists name, country and genre. Let's see which columns could potentially be used as our primary key. We can't use the country or genre columns as there are repeated values of data which breaks the rule that each value must be unique. It is possible to use the name column as a primary key as every artist should have a unique name. But normally we would add an id column which starts at 1 and automatically increments with every new row of data added to the table. We can then use this id column as our primary key.

## Creating a Primary Key Column

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c8be5fae3f"
```

`@part1`
SQL syntax for creating a primary key column: 

`CREATE TABLE artists (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    artists_name VARCHAR(50),
    country VARCHAR(30),
    genre VARCHAR(30)
);`


`@script`
We can define our primary key column when creating our tables. Here you can see the SQL to create the artists table in PostgreSQL. You can see the id column has a serial datatype. This is a specific datatype to PostgreSQL which will automatically increment the id column with each new row of data. To define the id column as a primary key we then just follow the serial datatype with the words primary key.

## What Are Foreign Keys

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "032ed86fc9"
```

`@part1`
They are used to identify relationships between tables. 

A foreign key is defined in one table and references the primary key of another table. 

The table containing the foreign key is called the child table. 

The table containing the primary key is called the parent table. 

A table can contain multiple foreign keys.


`@script`
Now let's take a look at foreign keys. Foreign keys are used to identify relationships between tables in a database. Foreign keys are defined in one table and reference primary key values in other tables. The tables containing the foreign keys are called child tables and the tables that the foreign keys are referencing are called parent tables. Unlike primary keys a table can contain multiple foreign keys. Let's take a look at an example of a foreign key.

## Example of a Foreign Key

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "7a5e569fb9"
```

`@part1`
Artists table: 

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/3491/datasets/675a2b16e72e9034d674bacfb754f0e11d8984e1/table_pk_2_r.JPG)

Songs table with foreign key column 'artists id':


`@script`
Here we have our artists table from before. Our database will also contain a songs table containing data about all the songs for our music app. In this table you can see we have an artists_id column. This is a foreign key column which is referencing the primary key id column in the artists table. So where we see a 1 in the artists_id column in the songs table, this is referring to Lady Gaga. Where we see a 2, Daft Punk and so on. Here we have used a foreign key to identify a relationship between the artists table and songs table.

## Creating a Foreign Key Column

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "4a09d9ad12"
```

`@part1`
SQL syntax for creating a foreign key column:

`CREATE TABLE songs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(50),
    duration NUMERIC(4,2),
    artists_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (artists_id) REFERENCES artists (id)
);`


`@script`
We can define our foreign keys when creating our tables. Here you can see the SQL to create the songs table from the previous slide. We define all our columns including the artists_id column which contains integers. We then add an extra line stating foreign key with the foreign key column in parenthesis then the keyword references followed by the artists table which we are references and then finally the id column from the artists table in parenthesis.

## Let's Practice

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "0cd9782e5e"
```

`@script`
So know we know about primary and foreign keys, let's practice what we have learned with some exercises.
